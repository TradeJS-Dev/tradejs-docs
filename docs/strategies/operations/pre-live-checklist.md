- Results include realistic assumptions (fees/slippage).
- No obvious overfitting to one period.

## Runtime Readiness

- Strategy config is loaded and validated.

- Stop-loss and take-profit logic is verified.

## Infrastructure Readiness

- `yarn doctor` passes required checks.
- Redis and Postgres are stable.
- ML inference endpoint is reachable if required.

## Safety Readiness

- Exposure limits are configured.
- Rollback plan is documented.
- Alerting is enabled for critical failures.
